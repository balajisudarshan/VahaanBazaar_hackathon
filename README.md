# Vahan Bazar ‚Äì Two-Wheeler Marketplace Web App

## üìå Problem Statement
Many users face difficulty in finding, comparing, and renting/buying two-wheelers online efficiently.  
Dealerships also struggle with inventory management and tracking sales.  

Vahan Bazar aims to provide a **centralized platform** where users can browse, compare, and buy/sell two-wheelers, while dealerships can manage inventory and sales digitally.

## üìù Project Summary

### Problem Understanding
The Indian two-wheeler market is huge, but finding, comparing, and buying bikes, scooters, and EVs online is fragmented.  
Existing platforms either focus on four-wheelers or lack dealership-friendly tools. Customers struggle with transparent pricing and easy booking.  

### Proposed Prototype Solution
- Customers can **browse, filter, and compare models** by brand, fuel type, and price.  
- Rich product pages with **images, detailed specs, EMI & fuel calculators**.  
- Sections for **upcoming launches, showrooms, and test ride bookings**.  
- Users can **sell used bikes** with a simple upload process.  
- Dealerships get a **backend dashboard** to manage inventory, sales, and analytics.  

### Uniqueness & Impact
- Focused exclusively on **2-wheelers**, unlike Cars24 or OLX.  
- Dual focus: **Customer-friendly marketplace** + **Dealer-friendly inventory management**.  
- Makes buying/selling **transparent, digital, and faster**, helping customers save time & money, while enabling dealerships to grow revenue.
