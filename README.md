Vahan Bazar – India’s Two-Wheeler Marketplace
Problem Statement

India is the largest two-wheeler market in the world with 15–17 million annual sales.
But the digital experience is broken for both buyers and dealers:

Buyers face challenges:

Listings are scattered across OLX, Quikr, BikeDekho.

No transparent brand comparisons.

No local test ride booking or real-time EMI/fuel cost tools.

Dealers face challenges:

Manual inventory tracking (paper/excel).

No analytics or sales insights.

Limited online presence in Tier-2 & Tier-3 cities, where demand is growing.

Vahan Bazar solves this by centralizing discovery, decision-making, and dealership into one trusted platform.

Market Understanding

80% of Indian households own a two-wheeler, yet online solutions are fragmented.

Buyers want finance clarity (EMI, running costs) before purchase.

EV adoption (~7% of sales in 2024) increases demand for range and charging cost tools.

Dealers are underserved, while digital-first startups in 4-wheelers (e.g., Cars24) dominate.
